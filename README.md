# Hi, I'm John Erinjery
I am a Second-year BS-MS Physics Research Student at <a href="https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/">IISER Pune</a>. Good to see you here!

I'm interested in astrophysics; especially gravitational astrophysics. I enjoy studying morphology of galaxies, dynamics of galaxy clusters and evolution of celestial objects, particularly stars and nebulae.

This repository contains my portfolio website; I update it often.
